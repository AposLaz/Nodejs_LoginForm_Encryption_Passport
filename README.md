## Building and Structuring a Node.js MVC application

The Node.js example aply MVC pattern (Model, View, Controller)

- Model: This is where we will define the properties of a user that will be store in our database.
- View: The view is where end users interact within the application. Simply put, this is where all the HTML template files go. ( ```.ejs``` files used here)
- Controller: The controller interacts with the model and serves the response and functionality to the view. When an end user makes a request, itâ€™s sent to the controller which interacts with the database.
